Assignment 1

Review the HTTP Headers in the Request and Response –create text file and
describe each key value pair in the HTTP header in both request and response
and check it in with the project to GitHub (e.g. what is the content-type and what does it mean)

Headers

Alt-Svc →hq=":443"; ma=2592000; quic=51303431; quic=51303339; quic=51303338; quic=51303337; quic=51303335,quic=":443"; ma=2592000; v="41,39,38,37,35"
alternative service, other places the request can be found

Cache-Control →private, max-age=0, must-revalidate, no-transform
Cache-control specify directives for caching mechanisms in both, requests and responses
private: private connection
max-age: max time fetched response is allowed to be reused from time of request
must-revalidate: cache must revalidate if response is stale
no-transform: cache can't change

Content-Encoding →gzip
The http can be gzip format

Content-Type →application/json; charset=UTF-8
content is JSON format, encoded in UTF-8 character encoding

Date →Sun, 04 Feb 2018 01:16:08 GMT
date and time message was sent

ETag →"f6QLsd8inUgRKJVNBqJ8xHnPb0w/4Y3QGt96qdbRG-eisfCf6ieAF0M"
identifier for the specific version of the resource

Expires →Sun, 04 Feb 2018 01:16:08 GMT
date and time message is stale

Server →GSE
the server that is used to handle the request

Transfer-Encoding →chunked
the form of encoding used to transfer the request/response

Vary →Origin
Determines how to match future request headers to decide whether a cached response can be used rather than requesting a fresh one from the origin server.

Vary →X-Origin
Determines how to match future request headers to decide whether a cached response can be used rather than requesting a fresh one from the origin server

X-Content-Type-Options →nosniff
X-Content-Type-Options is marker to indicate the MIME types in the Content-Type headers should not be changed. The value nosniff will prevent Internet Explorer from MIME-sniffing a response away from the declared content-type.

X-Frame-Options →SAMEORIGIN
Instructs the browser to prevent any site with SAMEORIGIN in the response from being rendered within a frame.

X-XSS-Protection →1; mode=block
This lets domains toggle on and off the "XSS Filter" of IE8, which prevents some categories of XSS attacks.
